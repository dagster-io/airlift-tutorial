## Airlift Tutorial Code

This repo is the code that the Airlift tutorial is based off of. Follow along on the main docs site [here](https://docs.dagster.io/integrations/airlift/tutorial).
This example demonstrates how to migrate an Airflow DAG to Dagster using the `dagster-airlift` package. It contains code examples of how to peer, observe, and migrate assets from an Airflow DAG to Dagster.
